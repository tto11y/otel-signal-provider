The otel-signal-provider is a simple Go project that sends OpenTelemetry signals to an OpenTelemetry endpoint (e.g. OpenTelemetry collector).

It's main purpose is to provide an easy to use application to verify an OpenTelemetry setup (e.g. OpenTelemetry collector, Tempo, Mimir, Grafana).

As of now, the application supports metrics and traces.
